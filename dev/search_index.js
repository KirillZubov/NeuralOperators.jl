It learns a operator, which is a mapping between infinite-dimensional function spaces. It can be used to resolve partial differential equations (PDE). Instead of solving by time-consuming finite element method, a PDE problem can be resolved by training a neural network to learn an operator mapping from infinite-dimensional space (u t) to infinite-dimensional space f(u t). Neural operator learns a continuous function between two continuous function spaces. The kernel can be trained on different geometry, including regular Euclidean space or a graph topology.","category":"page"},{"location":"introduction/#Fourier-Neural-Operators","page":"Introduction","title":"Fourier Neural Operators","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"introduction/","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"Fourier neural operator (FNO) learns a neural operator with Dirichlet kernel to form a Fourier transformation.
